# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This project uses JavaScript, CSS and html code to create a helpful day schedule that can be used to plan and organise time. This is a useful website for all users to better manage their time and daily routines. The current date and time is diplayed in the header so that the user is reminded what day they are planning for and how much time they have left in the day. This is presentented in blocks with the current buisness hour on the left, an area to input their own text in the middle adjacent to the corresponding time and a save button on the right. The user enters their plans/events and routines into the day schedulor and if they wish to save these plans they click the save button on the right. Once saved the user can refresh the page and their plans will still be visable as the events were saved in local storage. If a user wishes to remove or edit their plans they can retype or remove their text in the input area and save their changes again. The colour of each time block indicates whether the block is in the past present or future. If the time of the event is in the past the block is grey, if it is in present the block is red in colour and if it is in the future it is displayed in green.
